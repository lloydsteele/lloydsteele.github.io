# About
I'm a dermatology trainee/resident and Wellcome-funded Clinical PhD Fellow working with Prof Muzz Haniffa and Dr Mo Lotfollahi at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge. 

My main research interests are
         1) Why do skin diseases have a proclivity for certain sites (e.g. eczema on the antecubital fossa/inner elbow)? I'm particularly interested in the role of dermal fibroblasts in mediating site-specific disease risk 
         2) How does the skin “remember” inflammatory disease?
         3) AI in medicine (dermatology and dermatopathology specifically)
